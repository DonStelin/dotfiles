Configuration files for my daily tools, plus an init script to quickly set up the environment

- This config file can be easily installed using the script `init`
- These dotfiles are intended to run on top of [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/)
- Still WIP

```bash
 curl -fsSL https://dotfiles.stelin.dev | bash
```
